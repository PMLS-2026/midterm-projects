The language in the `README.txt` was less than clear, but the text of the problem clarified that the $508$ entries in the data files represent not _endpoints_ like the `README.txt` claimed, but measurements every $\\Delta_T = 30$ seconds, where $\\Delta_T$ is the time between measurements, so this dataset represents a _single_ random 2-D walk, with $507$ steps from the starting point, resulting in a total of $508$ measurements.
